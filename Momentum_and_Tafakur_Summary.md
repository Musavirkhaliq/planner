# Momentum and Tafakur Modules Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Momentum and Tafakur modules within the Planner application. These two key modules work together to enhance user engagement, track progress, and encourage daily reflection.

## 1. Momentum Module

### Core Functionality

The Momentum module is a gamification system designed to increase user engagement and motivation by rewarding actions with points, achievements, levels, and streaks.

### Key Components

#### 1.1 Point System

- **Dynamic Point Allocation**: Users earn points for various actions:
  - Task completion (3 points)
  - Goal completion (15 points)
  - Goal step completion (5 points)
  - Time slot completion (7 points)
  - Perfect week bonus (30 points)
  - Reflection completion (5 points)
  - And many more categories

- **Multipliers**: Additional points are awarded for:
  - Streaks (consecutive activity)
  - Task complexity
  - Time-based bonuses (early bird/night owl)

#### 1.2 Achievement System

Organizes accomplishments into categories:
- **Productivity**: Task and goal completion milestones
- **Consistency**: Streak-based achievements
- **Time Management**: Schedule and timing-based achievements
- **Focus**: Deep work and concentration achievements
- **Growth**: Learning and reflective achievements
- **Social**: Community interaction achievements

Each achievement has:
- Name
- Description
- Point value
- Category
- Criteria type (count, streak, time, compound)
- Criteria value (target required)
- Icon name (for display)

#### 1.3 Level System

A progressive level system where users advance by accumulating points:
- Each level requires exponentially more points
- Levels include unique titles and perks
- Unlockable features (backgrounds, analytics, badges, etc.)

#### 1.4 Streak System

Maintains streaks for consistent behavior:
- Multiple streak types (tasks, reflections, etc.)
- Daily activity tracking
- Bonus points for streak milestones

### Backend Implementation

The Momentum backend is implemented with these key components:

1. **Router (`app/momentum/router.py`)**: 
   - Defines API endpoints for accessing momentum features
   - Provides methods for getting progress, leaderboard data, achievements, and streaks
   - Processes momentum events from user actions

2. **Services (`app/momentum/services.py`)**:
   - Core business logic for processing events and calculating points
   - Methods for checking achievements, updating streaks, and managing levels
   - Functions for generating leaderboards and statistics

3. **Configuration (`app/momentum/momentum.py`)**:
   - Defines constants and enums for achievement categories and criteria types
   - Contains point values for different event types
   - Lists all available achievements and their requirements
   - Specifies level requirements and perks

4. **Schemas (`app/momentum/schemas.py`)**:
   - Defines Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
   - Models for User Progress, Achievements, Streaks, and Leaderboard entries

### Frontend Implementation

The Momentum frontend (`frontend/templates/momentum.html`) provides a user-friendly interface for displaying:

1. **Profile Header**:
   - Current level with progress bar
   - Total points and level title

2. **Stats & Streaks Section**:
   - Weekly and monthly points
   - Current rank on leaderboard

   - Ranking of users by points
   - Highlights the current user's position

## 2. Tafakur Module

### Core Functionality

The Tafakur module (meaning "reflection" or "contemplation") provides a structured daily reflection system to help users process their experiences, learn from challenges, and cultivate gratitude.

### Key Components

  - Users can tag reflections for categorization
  - Tags are used for trend analysis

#### 2.2 Streak Tracking

- Monitors consecutive days of reflection
- Rewards consistent reflection with points and achievements
- Displays current and longest streaks

#### 2.3 Insights Generation

- Analyzes reflection patterns
- Provides mood trends over time
- Identifies common themes from tags

### Backend Implementation

The Tafakur backend consists of:

1. **Router (`app/tafakur/router.py`)**:
   - API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting reflections
   - Endpoints for retrieving streaks and insights
   - Methods for accessing reflections by date

2. **Services (`app/tafakur/services.py`)**:
   - CRUD operations for reflections
   - Streak maintenance and validation
   - Insight generation from reflection data
   - Momentum point integration (awards points for reflections)

3. **Models (`app/tafakur/models.py`)**:
   - Database models for reflections and tags
   - Relationships with user model

4. **Schemas (`app/tafakur/schemas.py`)**:
   - Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
   - Models for Reflection, ReflectionCreate, ReflectionUpdate, etc.

### Frontend Implementation

The Tafakur frontend (`frontend/templates/tafakur.html`) provides:

1. **Header Section**:
   - Current reflection streak display
   - Basic explanation of the reflection process

2. **Reflection Form**:
   - Date selector
   - Mood selector with visual indicators
   - Text areas for highlights, challenges, gratitude, lessons, and tomorrow's goals
   - Tag input field
   - Privacy toggle

3. **Insights Panel**:
   - Streak progress visualization
   - Mood trend chart
   - Tag cloud showing common themes
   - History of recent reflections

## 3. Integration Between Modules

The Momentum and Tafakur modules are tightly integrated:

1. **Point System Integration**:
   - Completing reflections awards Momentum points
   - Maintaining reflection streaks provides additional points
   - Weekly reflections offer bonus points

2. **Achievement Integration**:
   - Tafakur-specific achievements (Self-Aware, Reflection Seeker, Contemplation Master)
